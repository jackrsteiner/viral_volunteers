            "body": "The Mayo Clinic has been named the national site for Convalescent Plasma Expanded Access\r\nProgram and will be the lead institution providing coordinated access to investigational\r\nconvalescent plasma for hospitalized patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, or those\r\nat high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease.\r\nThe program grew from a national initiative of physicians and investigators from over 40\r\ninstitutions who self-organized to investigate the use of convalescent plasma during the\r\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These institutions include Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University,\r\nWashington University, Einstein Medical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,\r\nMichigan State University (see more information about individual locations below).\r\nTo donate, the general requirements are:\r\n\u25cf You must have been symptom-free for a period of time, usually at least 14 days.\r\n\u25cf If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you will need to show that you now have a\r\nnegative test. You can begin that process yourself by contacting the organization that\r\ntested you in the first place. Some locations that take plasma may be able to provide the\r\nCOVID-19 test, but most will not.\r\n\u25cf If you think you had COVID-19, but did not actually have a positive test, the donation site\r\nwill likely test your blood to see if you have antibodies to the virus, which will tell you\r\nwhether you were infected with the virus in the past\r\n\u25cf Donation sites may request that you wear a mask while donating.",
